# hmd-global-demography-analysis
This project analyzes demographic data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) to uncover long-term population and health trends across 7 countries (Canada, USA, Japan, and others).

The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics pipeline:

- Data ingestion: Extract raw HMD files, load into MySQL using Python ETL.

- Data validation: Ensure completeness and consistency of deaths, births, population, and life expectancy datasets.

- Data transformation: Generate country-level and sex-specific aggregates (e.g., crude death rate, gender gap in life expectancy).

- Analysis & visualization: Use SQL + Python (Pandas, Seaborn) for exploration and publish interactive dashboards in Tableau Public.

The outcome is a set of actionable demographic insights (life expectancy trends, birth–death balance, aging patterns) and a reusable analytics workflow that can be extended to more countries or combined with external data (e.g., economic indicators, pandemics).

### ✅ Completion Criteria

- Data Ingestion & Storage
